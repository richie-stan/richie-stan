### Hi there, I'm Richie ðŸ‘‹

## A lifetime student of life, developer, guitarist and a big fan of animals. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ' 100 days of Coding Challenge '.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and JS via Pluralsight courses. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with people that are working in this industry. 
- ðŸ’¬ My 2021 goals: 
1. Get hired as a React Developer.
2. Contribute more to Open Source projects.
3. Create at least 5 React apps that others could find useful. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I managed to have a normal conversation for 1 hour in a language that I didn't know.
